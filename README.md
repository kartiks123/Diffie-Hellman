# Diffie-Hellman

This is our Mini Project. It is possible to conceal critical or private information with encryption by making it look as though nothing unusual is happening. A person who reads the cypher text won't understand that it contains any hidden information. Encryption basically takes advantage of human perception because our senses are not designed to search for files with information inside of them. This system enables users to exchange text messages in an encrypted format, which prevents hackers from reading the messages even if they get access to the system. The system also provides a key or password to lock the text. To decode the secret text, the receiver will require the key. The user then transmits the key to the recipient, inputs the key or password to decrypt the text, and pushes the decrypt key to retrieve the sender's secret content. Since it makes use of public key strategies to enable the sharing of a private encryption key, Diffie-Hellman key exchange provides the best of both worlds. By employing this technique, you may double check that your secret message is transmitted without interruption from outside hackers or attackers. If the sender sends this encrypted text in public, the recipient will get it without anybody else knowing what it is. To keep all relevant data, the system makes use of an online database. The project may be accessible in a web browser using Azure link since the project files and a database file will be stored in the Azure cloud.
